LOMBOK ANNOTATIONS:(*https://projectlombok.org/features)

@NonNull:
The @NonNull annotation can be used to generate a null check on a setter field,

@Cleanup:
Automatic resource management: Call your close() methods safely with no hassle.

@Data:
A shortcut for @ToString, @EqualsAndHashCode, @Getter on all fields, @Setter on all non-final fields,
and @RequiredArgsConstructor!

@AllArgsConstructor:(the common one,doesnt come with @Data)
 generates a constructor with 1 parameter for each field in your class.

 @Builder:
produces complex builder APIs for your classes.

@RequiredArgsConstructor:(comes with @Data)
 generates a constructor with 1 parameter for each field that requires special handling.
 All non-initialized final fields get a parameter, as well as any fields that are marked as @NonNull that aren't initialized where they are declared.
